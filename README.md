# My Coding Portfolio
This is a place where I can hopefully show off my coding skills to recruiters. Directories that end in 'course' are class assignments while completing my undergraduate degree at UT-Austin. The LeetCode folders will slowly grow, and I add to them whenever there is a solution I had not thought of and could
learn from.

Code will either have a readme, an assignment file, or an explanation in the file itself.

Regards,
Tanner
